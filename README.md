# Python-challenge
Module 3 Challenge

This challenge composes of two separate data sets: PyBank and PyPoll. Each data set was analyzed by using a python script that read the csv file, examined the data to extract requested information using various methods which printed in the terminal and was also writ to a text file. 

The first dataset examined was PyBank, a financial data set that had two columns: date & profit/losses. The python script creted for this dataset analyzes and calculates the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of profit/losses, the change from one profit/loss row to the next, average change of the profit/losses, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in profits. It prints these results in the terminal and also exports a file (new.csv) with the results.

The second dataset examined was PyPoll, a voter dataset which had three columns: ballot id, county and candidate. The script created for this data set analyzes and calculates the total number of votes cast, the candidates who received votes, the total number of votes each candidate received as well as the percentage of votes each candidate received and finally the candidate who received the most votes. This script also prints in the terminal and exports a file (election_results.csv) with the results.
