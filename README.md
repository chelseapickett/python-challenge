# Python-challenge
Module 3 Challenge

There are two datasets in this challenge:
- PyBank
- PyPoll

Each data set was analyzed by using a python script that read the csv file, examined the data, extracted requested information using various methods which printed in the terminal and was also written to a text file. 

The first dataset examined was PyBank, a financial data set that has two columns: date & profit/losses. The python script creted for this dataset analyzes and calculates:
- Total number of months in the dataset
- Net total amount of profit/losses
- Change from one profit/loss row to the next
- Average change of the profit/losses 
- Greatest increase in profits 
- Greatest decrease in profits 

It prints these results in the terminal and also exports a file (new.csv) with the results.

The second dataset examined was PyPoll, a voter dataset which has three columns: ballot id, county and candidate. The script created for this data set analyzes and calculates:
- the total number of votes cast, 
- the candidates who received votes, 
- the total number of votes each candidate received 
- the percentage of votes each candidate received  
- candidate who received the most votes. 

This script also prints in the terminal and exports a file (election_results.csv) with the results.
